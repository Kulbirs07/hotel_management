# Hotel-Management-System
The Hotel Management System is a R-DBMS project that will help to ease the check-in, 
check out, and booking process of a certain hotel. This system allows the hotel 
management to store all the rooms of their hotel along with the room category and prices 
per day. The rooms that being stored will be used for managing the availability of the 
rooms.

In Hotel Booking Management System we use PHP and MySQL Database. This project 
keeps records of booking, clients, and hotel services. Hotel Booking Management 
System has two modules i.e., admin and user.

It contains the admin section and the user (customer) section. All the editing’s, updating, 
managing rooms, bookings, and payment are for the admin section. The design of this 
system is made as simple as possible so that the user won’t get any difficulties while 
working on it.
